# FastAPI Email Service

This project demonstrates how to send emails using FastAPI and FastMail. It includes a simple API endpoint that allows users to send emails to a list of recipients.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need the following:

- Python 3.6 or later
- FastAPI
- FastMail
- Jinja2
- A SMTP server (e.g. Gmail, SendGrid)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/fastapi-mail/fastapi-mail-example.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

Before you can run the project, you will need to configure your SMTP server credentials in the `.env` file:

```
MAIL_USERNAME=your-smtp-username
MAIL_PASSWORD=your-smtp-password
MAIL_FROM=your-smtp-from-address
MAIL_PORT=your-smtp-port
MAIL_SERVER=your-smtp-server
```

## Usage

To send an email, simply make a POST request to the `/send/email` endpoint with the following JSON payload:

```
{
  "email": ["recipient1@example.com", "recipient2@example.com"],
  "body": "Hello, world!"
}
```

The `email` field should contain a list of recipient email addresses, and the `body` field should contain the email message.

## Customizing the Email Template

The project uses Jinja2 to render the email template. You can customize the template by modifying the `email.html` file in the `templates` directory.

## Running the Project

To run the project, simply run the following command:

```
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

This will start the FastAPI server on port 8000.

## Conclusion

This project provides a simple example of how to send emails using FastAPI and FastMail. It can be easily customized to meet your specific needs.
